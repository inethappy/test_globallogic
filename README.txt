LINUX / MacOS

To build the project:

$./money_maker
To run tests:
$sh test.sh
To delete all the object files:
$make clean
To delete all the object files and executables:

WINDOWS

For the correct display of the program on Windows, it is necessary that the compiler and the GNUmake tool are installed, which may not be very pleasant to install. So just in case, I put here a compiled executable called money_maker.exe. Then in the console to display the Ukrainian language you need to enter the command: $chcp 65001.
